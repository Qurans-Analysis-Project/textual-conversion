converting a PDF into a unicode file takes several steps:
1) The fonts for the pdf need to be extracted using the website: pdf2go.com
2) Each font file is opened using FontForge and each glyph needs to be mapped to its corresponding unicode character.
Mapping each character is done by hand.
3) The python script is run to convert each PDF font's glyph into its unicode counterpart.
It uses the character mapping provided in the previous step. This becomes the unicode .txt file
