This script pulls the arabic unicode text from https://quran.al-shia.org/en/tartil/
Since this text is not pulled from a file into unicode to text
but rather from online unicode directly then it's output is sent straight to
the generated/json folder under its source.
It would be possible to save the text in a .txt file but that is more of an intermediate step
to break it up into JSON for further analysis anyway.
