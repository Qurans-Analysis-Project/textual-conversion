I went to here: https://audio.islamweb.net/audio/index.php?page=rewayat
They list 21 readings they have as well as couple other links
Each reading has a link to download a pdf of the whole quran

In case they're later delisted, the links to get to the pdf online take a standard form:
https://dl2.islamweb.net/Audio_Path/quran_list/<name here>/quran.pdf
where the name is placed in the next to last path location. Here's an example for warsh:
https://dl2.islamweb.net/Audio_Path/quran_list/warsh/quran.pdf
Simply take the filename, caps or no caps, numbers or no numbers, exactly as is, and place the name there.
That's the link where I originally got it from.
